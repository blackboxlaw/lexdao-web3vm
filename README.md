MetaCartel - Dragon Quest : LexDAO - Web3vm Ethereum & IPFS React Application


**CONTEST PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

--------------------------------------------------------

## Web3vm Ethereum & IPFS React Application

# üî• **$350, $100, $50, and 10 X $10 to the best smart-contract template integration as part of MetaCartel's Dragon Quest Hackathon.**

**CONTEST PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
--------------------------------------------------------
üî∑ Create a modern-looking React front-end application where the user can easily navigate the UI in a well defined step-minimized UX.  We want to see Web3 ready webpages that use published smart-contract and integrated templates found at OpenLaw official.  **https://lib.openlaw.io/web/default** 

Winners must have a well-tested application, and we don't expect to see any bugs.

No back-end databases are required. 

Application must be Web3, Ethereum, and IPFS ready. 
Integrations are already functioning in our existing applications referenced below.

üî∂ All the integrations of the smart-contracts can be handled by pre-existing referenced smart-contracts so no solidity programming is required; however some of the referenced contracts are deployed and published only on Rinkeby. If you optionally choose one of these Rinkeby deployed smart-contracts you can customize the deployment; however, the smart-contract must be published on the Ethereum mainnet to be eligible to win the contest.

The Web3 on-boarding will require Metamask, Wallet Connect, Formatic, Portis, TorUs, UniLogin, ENS, 3Box or any other popular signing account/wallet.  The application must be responsive and viewed on standard sizes of desktop monitors and mobile devices.

All code will be open source.


üîë  **THE SITUATION** 
------------------------------------------- 

We offer pre-existing smart-contracts for simple use cases that are interfaced with official OpenLaw markdown language.  You will have the opportunity to design and integrate a simple user experience and interface that takes existing provided Solidity code and integrates it in to a simple React front-end.  All the code is provided to you in referenced files and Github repositories.  Your goals is to provide a modern-look that we will use as a starting point for our Web3vm and LexDAO decentralized applications (dApps). 


üöÄ **OPENLAW AND LEXDAO** 
---------------------------------------------- 

The Ethereum blockchain optimizes the performance of OpenLaw agreements by allowing users to have a common source-of-truth about executed commitments in a distributed, durable financial and accounting. 

The OpenLaw templates use a markup language to transform natural language agreements into machine-readable objects with relevant variables and logic defined within a given document.Templates can be grouped together making it possible for parties to create and manage entire project and client claims safely, securely and confidentially on the Ethereum blockchain using encryption and elliptical-curve mathematics.

For example, the Structure metatype lets you define a list of related variables bundled into one grouping and a Collection metatype is list of values the user provides. You can also use conditionals to embed advanced logic into an agreement for dynamic and customizable legal agreements. Most importantly OpenLaw also provides tools that enable electronic signatures that are timestamped and recorded on the public Ethereum blockchain. 


üìô **CONTEST PROCEDURAL STEPS**
---------------------------------------------------------

1. A live, working React application. Code available for review on Github page. Must use the work-in-process Github repository for final deployment and to list any issues and pull requests.
**https://github.com/blackboxlaw/lexdao-web3vm**

2. Must use OpenLaw markup language to customize a form template for use in the target dApp
**https://www.openlaw.io/**

3. Must create a document (approximately 1,000 words) explaining any hyperlinks, form fields and the general UX flow.

4. Must submit the document described in #3 above, and either a short video, slide-deck, or other simple design framework to IPFS using the Web3vm file upload option and must capture the IPFS hash and the mainnet transaction hash. Use the Inspect Element - Console in your browser (right click on Web3vm.com webpage) 
**https://web3vm.com/#magic** 

5. Must upload the project as a branch of **https://github.com/blackboxlaw/lexdao-web3vm**


üí≤ ** CONTEST PAYOUT DETAILS**  
-----------------------------------------------------
Bounty payout is a Contest that will be paid out of a LexDAO secured custodial account.  
Contest payout 1st place $350, 2nd Place $100 3rd Place $50 paid in one of the following: USD/DAI/ETH.
Honorable mentions $10 USD/DAI/ETH each up to 10 submissions.
Contest awards will be forwarded only to the the web3 address that submits the work onto IPFS and the Ethereum mainnet in Step 4 above.
IPFS hash and Ethereum main net transaction required to be eligible.

Custody of the funds are located at 
**https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/lexdragon/0xb4faca3dd1feca8ed5a45dd002c34dcc3a4a3fb6/**
LDX (LexDAI) is a wrapped ERC20 token interchangeable for DAI. 


üî∑ **NOTES TO HELP GET STARTED**  
---------------------------------------------------------
This is the example of a fully functioning template which gives you all you need to run it and interact with the Ethereum public blockchain.  The application you submit must be integrated similarly.

üí• **ADVANCED RESOURCES TO DOMINATE THE CONTEST**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Review the Reference website for how OpenLaw templates work.
**https://github.com/openlawteam/openlaw-elements**

2. Select working template from curated list:
mtf-408-openlaw-template-solidity-ref.txt
**https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmUAHBejAJRFqdX65b2Ts1ZK9q9v8bjxM7zd4LyVYzDM5k**

3. Find the corresponding template and store markdown and variables 
**https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmbW8LK9tQf9cr9dNtJnnrDfWAKAn72zMsunzHTHrx4BUw**

4. Locate the associated smart-contract and reference the ABI from the IPFS hash and integrate it into the dApp.
Reference OpenLaw templates. Itemized variables, ABI, smart-contracts and functions from this list:

üìó **ADDITIONAL HACKABLE LEXDAO SITES (OPTIONAL HACK)** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LexDAO Registry (TLDR) is a dapp to record (i) basic legal agreements, with (ii) token escrows, and (iii) arbitration-by-LexDAO using the Aragon Agent application.

Prototype site for reference and to hack on.
https://github.com/blackboxlaw/TLDR

Or take any solidity file resource from here and integrate into a workable wired template.
https://github.com/lexDAO


LexDAO has recently revamped the underlying TLDR smart contract, simplifying its legal storage and token escrow functions to now basically just store a HASH reference and release $CHAI tokens (converted automatically from deposited $DAI).

This `DAI Savings Escrow` implementation should live on a revamped lexdao.club that removes the following deprecated functions:

The ‚ÄúSelect/Read a LexScript‚Äù tab on the landing page (TLDR will now simply just use hash references from external sources . . . .)

lexPULSE tracking  for LEX tokens (deprecated system for TLDR internal reputation . . . now managed by Aragon DAOs . . . .)

And provides access to new functions in the Dai Savings Escrow smart contract, such as:

$CHAI functionality for escrow recipient parties: a clone of https://stablecoin.services/ or https://chai.money/ would be highly useful to track Chai / Dai balance, transfer, as well as unwrap ‚Äòinterest‚Äô from DSR

Otherwise, the legacy TLDR components for disputing an escrow and managing registered escrow should remain useful. This code base can be reviewed here: https://github.com/lexDAO/TLDR
